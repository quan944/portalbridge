PortalBridge is a **token bridge** that enables seamless asset transfers between multiple blockchain networks, utilizing the **PortalBridge** infrastructure. This project is built on the **Aptos** blockchain, providing secure and efficient cross-chain interoperability.

## Features

-   **Cross-Chain Transfers**: Move assets between different blockchains with ease.
    
-   **Security & Reliability**: Utilizes trusted mechanisms to ensure the safety of transferred tokens.
    
-   **High Performance**: Built on Aptos, ensuring fast and low-cost transactions.
    
-   **Scalability**: Designed to support multiple assets and expand to additional blockchains in the future.
    

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Aptos CLI
    
-   Move Language
    
-   Node.js & npm (for front-end integration if applicable)
    
-   Rust (for smart contract development)
    

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/quan944/portalbridge.git
    cd portalbridge
    ```
    
2.  Install dependencies:
    
    ```
    npm install  # If there's a front-end component
    ```
    
3.  Compile the smart contract:
    
    ```
    aptos move compile --named-addresses portal_bridge=your_address
    ```
    

## Usage

### Deploying the Contract

1.  Set up your Aptos wallet and obtain test tokens.
    
2.  Deploy the contract:
    
    ```
    aptos move publish --named-addresses portal_bridge=your_address
    ```
    
3.  Verify deployment and interact with the contract.
    

### Sending Tokens

Use the PortalBridge interface to transfer assets between chains by interacting with the deployed contract. Ensure that the receiving chain supports the token bridge mechanism.
